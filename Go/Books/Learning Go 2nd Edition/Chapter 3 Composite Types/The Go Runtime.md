Every high-level language relies on a set of libraries to enable programs written in that language to run, and Go is no exception. The Go runtime provides services like memory allocation and garbage collection, concurrency support, networking, and implementations of built-in types and functions.

The Go runtime is compiled into every Go binary. This is different from languages that use a virtual machine, which must be installed separately to allow programs written in those languages to function. Including the runtime in the binary makes it easier to distribute Go programs and avoid worries about compatibility issues between the runtime and the program. The drawback of including the runtime in the binary is that even the simplest Go program produces a binary that's about 2 MB.
