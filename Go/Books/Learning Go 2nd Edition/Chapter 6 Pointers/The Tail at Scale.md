Jeffrey Dean, the genius behind many of Google's engineering successes, cowrote a paper in 2013 called [The Tail at Scale](https://oreil.ly/cvLpa). It argues that the systems should be optimized for latency, to keep response times low. The garbage collector used by the Go runtime favors low latency. Each garbage collection cycle is designed to "stop the world" (i.e. pause your program) for fewer than 500 microseconds. However, if your Go program creates lots of garbage, the garbage collector won't be able to find all the garbage during a cycle, slowingt he collector and increasing memory usage.
