>The reflect package contains a function called DeepEqual that can compare almost anything including slices. It's a legacy function, primarily intended for testing. Before the inclusion of slices.Equal and slices.EqualFunc, reflect.DeepEqual was often used to compare slices. Don't use it in new code, as it is slower and less safe than using the functions in the slices package.
